🚘 Building the Future of Connected Vehicles

Hi, I’m Rajeev Parmar, CTO & Co-Founder at BharatNex Energy Pvt. Ltd. — a deep-tech startup developing the communication backbone for connected vehicles.

Our mission is simple yet bold:
To enable vehicles to talk to each other — sharing position and intent in real time — so they can coordinate maneuvers, avoid collisions, and reduce congestion, even where the internet is unreliable.

💡 Why This Matters

Today’s connected systems depend heavily on cloud connectivity and expensive automation.
Our solution changes that — it’s a precise, affordable retrofit module powered by a decentralized vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network.
No costly infrastructure. No dependency on the internet. Just seamless safety and coordination for every vehicle.

🚀 Key Use Cases

Real-time collision avoidance & ADAS-to-ADAS coordination

Emergency services & prioritized incident alerts

Smart mobility and traffic management for cities and highways

Smart tolling, roadside infrastructure connectivity, fleet telematics, and ADAS diagnostics

🧠 Proof We’re Practical

🏆 Winners of SAE A-Baja (2024 & 2025)

🚗 Demonstrated ADAS-to-ADAS coordination on production vehicles

🌐 Conducted a live multi-node peer mesh demo at SIF SGSITS, Indore

💰 Funded by Startup India & selected by IIT Kanpur for the 5G/6G CoE Network Program

🧾 Hold a patent securing our market-ready communication technology

🤝 What’s Next

We’re now seeking pilot partners in logistics and terminal operations to validate ROI and scale deployments.
